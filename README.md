# Next.js Authentication Error: Rendering Protected Content Without Authentication Check

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications: rendering protected content without first verifying the user's authentication status.  The error occurs when attempting to access a route (e.g., `/about`) that requires authentication before the authentication status has been checked.

## The Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to render sensitive information without checking if the user is logged in. This leads to an error or unexpected behavior if the user is not authenticated.

## The Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file demonstrates how to solve this issue by adding an authentication check before rendering the protected content.  This ensures that only authenticated users can access the protected route.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.  You will see the error occur.
5. To see the fix, replace `about.js` with `aboutSolution.js` and restart the development server.
